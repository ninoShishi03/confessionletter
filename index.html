                        &emsp; I'll be honest (legit), I've been keeping this to myself for a while, but I feel like you already know what's going on. I have a huge crush on you — I've had one since the middle of March, actually. That's why I've always been active on the Discord server: so I could talk to you on VC. You even got me to play games I don’t usually play, just to spend time with you.
                    </span>
                    <br> <br>
                    <span>
                        &emsp;  As for why I like you? It's because I find you fun to be with and genuinely attractive. My heart always beats fast whenever I’m near you.

You don’t have to respond to this confession right away (take your time), but I just really wanted to get this off my chest. I know you’re busy, but I want you to know I’ve missed you — I customized this website because If I say this IRL I'd probably stutter a lot.
